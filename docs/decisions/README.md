# Decision Architecture Records (DARs)

This directory contains Decision Architecture Records for the k8s-infra project.

## Purpose

DARs document important architectural decisions made during the development and operation of our Kubernetes infrastructure. Each DAR captures the context, decision, and consequences of significant choices.

## Format

DARs follow a structured format that includes:
- Context: The situation requiring a decision
- Decision: The change being considered or decided
- Status: Current state (proposed, accepted, rejected, etc.)
- Consequences: What becomes easier or harder as a result

## Index

<!-- Add links to completed DARs here -->
- [DAR-001: Kubernetes Installation Method](./001-kubernetes-installation-method.md) - *In Progress*

## Guidelines

- Use descriptive filenames: `###-brief-decision-title.md`
- Start with the issue template and evolve during research
- Update the index above when adding new DARs
- Keep decisions focused and actionable
- Include implementation guidance where relevant
